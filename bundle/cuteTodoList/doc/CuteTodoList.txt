*cuteTodoList*

1. Why a Cute Todo list that even kitteh can't match ?~
    The aim of this plug-in is to provide a nice 'to do' list which doesn't
    interfere with your code. All the things to do are stored in separate
    files.

        Moreover the tasks can have priorities, and be sorted accordingly,
    which help to manage the work flow without leaving Vim.

        The files containing tasks are stored at two distinct places : >
            ~/.global.todo.txt
            $pwd/.todo.txt
<
    The global one is stored on your home directory, opened every time you use
    the to-do list. The local one is intended to be used as a project-specific
    list.

        This plug-in can also extract all tasks gathered in your open buffer.
    If you mark something TODO in your document, you will see it appear in the
    list after the next (manual) update.
     
      To be able to use this plugin, you must put : >
        set nocompatible
>   somwhere on your .vimrc
